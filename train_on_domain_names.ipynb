      "\n",
      "The newly discovered samples seem to predate the ones documented in our original research. They attempt to disguise as fake job offerings and have been initially released on Oct. 13, 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "Research on the command and control infrastructure has also shed some light on the main goal of the operation. Among the many victims we identified are several companies operating in the crypto-currency space. We are now in the process of notifying them about the attack.\n",

      "Along with the malware itself, the script also downloads a decoy PDF file holding a confidentiality agreement. The PDF file itself does not have any malicious purpose and serves as a decoy to distract users from the attack itself:\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "These samples have 2 user-defined functions, main.execCommand and main.sendDataToServer. Their purpose is to collect information about the victim’s machine and its network connections using the system\\_profiler and networksetup utilities, part of the macOS operating system.\n",
